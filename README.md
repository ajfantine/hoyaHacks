fMoods: Feelin' Hungry?
<p> 
We've included the predict.py and word_splitter.py files that we used to create our Google Cloud AutoML Natural Language Processing model. The json file is for our Amazon Alexa Skill, and the feeling_hungry.py file is our AWS Lambda back-end.

We won 1st place in the AWS Cloud Integration at Hoya Hacks 2019
